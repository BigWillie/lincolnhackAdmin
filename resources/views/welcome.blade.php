                Lincoln Hack is a free 24 hour coding competition where teams of up to four people compete for fantastic
                prizes. They start with an idea and build it in to something. Hardware hacks, software hacks, API
                mash-ups, funny things, arty things, noisy things... whatever you decide to create, youâ€™ve got 24 hours
                to do it!

            </p>

                Lincoln Hack is in it's second year and is still celebrating it's success from last year.
                This year, it is being held to coincide with Lincolnshire Tech Week, and moves to a new
                building.
                We plan to keep the great atmosphere though and fun and mix of great people, from students to veterans
                all are welcome as long as your interested in tech, willing to build something and enjoy meeting like minded
                people you will enjoy it we are sure.
